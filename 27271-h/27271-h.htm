<p>"The crescendo of quarrel is most skilfully and drolly arranged;&mdash;
scene on classic lines boldly challenging and, what is more, maintaining
comparison with Sheridan." Mr. A. B. Walkley&mdash;The London Times.</p>

<p>"This new play, by Mr. Henry Arthur Jones, at The Haymarket, is surely
as good a comedy as he has ever written.</p>

<p>I should say, in evaluating Mr. Jones, that his greatest asset is his
humor. We are grateful that Mr. Jones has that comfortable gift which
prevents him from dancing on us&mdash;that gift of humor whereby he is
content to take us just as we are.</p>

<p>No playwright is more joyously observant than Mr. Jones; and none
observes more accurately, in the milieu that he has chosen. Other
playwrights may create more salient and memorable figures. But none of
them creates figures so lifelike as Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>Nor is any one of them so fine a craftsman. We are not made conscious of
it while the play is in progress. From the very outset, we are aware
merely of certain ladies and gentlemen behaving with apparent freedom
and naturalness. It is only when the play is over that we notice the art
of it. The verisimilitude of "Dolly Reforming Herself" is all the more
admirable because the play is founded on a philosophic question, and in
the whole course of it there is not a scene, not a character (not even
the butler's character), that is not strictly and logically relevant to
this question. The whole fabric is wrought in a tight and formal
pattern, yet the effect of it is as life itself. The question in point
is "Can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> we cure ourselves of our bad habits?" and the answer is worked
not through a story, but simply through the behavior of a few people in
a country-house.</p>

<p>The central scene of the play, however, is the scene between Dolly and
her husband. The whole scene is delightful, worked out with the finest
sense of dramatic rhythm: a truly great comic scene, of which Mr. Jones
may well be proud."</p>

Surrey. A well-furnished room in a modern red brick country house. At
the back, a little to the right, is a door leading into the hall. All
along the right side is a glass partition, showing a conservatory which
is entered by glass doors, one up stage, the other down. On the left
side is a large fireplace. At the back, in the centre, is a handsome
writing-desk with a shut down flap lid. Above the fireplace, facing the
audience is a large sofa. To the right of sofa, and below it in the left
centre of the room is a small table, and near to it an easy chair. Right
centre down stage is a larger table.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <i>The afternoon of</i> <span class="smcap">1st</span> <i>January</i>, 1907.</p>

about thirty, busied with bills and papers. Bending over her, back to
audience, is her father</i>, <span class="smcap">Matt Barron</span>, <i>a pleasant-looking, easy-going
cynic of sixty.</i> <span class="smcap">Harry Telfer</span>, <span class="smcap">Dolly's</span> <i>husband, an ordinary
good-natured, weakish, impulsive Englishman about thirty-five, is
standing with his back to the fire. Sitting on sofa, reading a
scientific book, is</i> <span class="smcap">Professor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></span> <span class="smcap">Sturgess</span>, <i>a hard, dry, narrow, fattish
scientific man about forty-five. At the table, right, reading a French
novel, is</i> <span class="smcap">Renie Sturgess</span>, <i>the Professor's wife, a tall, dark, handsome
woman about thirty</i>.</p>


<p><i>Harry</i>. No, I can't say that I pay very much attention to sermons as a
rule, but Pilcher gave us a regular downright, no-mistake-about-it,
rouser at the Watch-night Service last night.</p>

<p><i>Matt</i>. [<i>Turning round</i>.] I wonder what precise difference this rousing
sermon will make in the conduct of any person who heard it.</p>

<p><i>Harry</i>. Well, it's going to make a lot of difference in my conduct. At
least, I won't say a lot of difference, because I don't call myself a
very bad sort of fellow, do you?</p>

<p><i>Matt</i>. N-o&mdash;No&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry</i>. At any rate I'm a thundering good husband, ain't I, Dolly?
[<span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>takes no notice</i>.] And I've got no flagrant vices. But I've got
a heap of&mdash;well a heap of selfish little habits, such as temper, and so
on, and for the coming year I'm going to knock them all off.</p>

<p><i>Matt</i>. That will be a score for Pilcher&mdash;that is, if you do knock them
off.</p>

<p><i>Harry</i>. Oh, I'm thoroughly resolved! I promised Dolly last night,
didn't I, Dolly? [<span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>takes no notice</i>.] Dolly too! Dolly was awfully
impressed by the sermon, weren't you, Dolly?</p>

<p><i>Matt</i>. [<i>Looking round at</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly's</span> <i>back</i>.] Dolly was awfully
impressed?</p>

<p><i>Harry</i>. Yes. Before we went to bed she gave me her word, that if I'd
give her a little help, she'd pay off all her bills, and live within her
allowance for the future, didn't you, Dolly?</p>

<p><i>Matt</i>. Well, that will be another score for Pilcher&mdash;that is, if Dolly
does live within her allowance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh, Dolly means it this time, don't you Dolly?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Turns round on her stool, bills in hand.</i>] I think it's
disgraceful!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> These tradespeople! [<i>Comes down to</i> <span class="smcap">Matt</span>.] I'm almost sure
I've paid this bill once&mdash;if not twice. Then there's a mistake of thirty
shillings in the addition&mdash;you're good at figures, Dad. Do add that up
for me. My head is so muddled.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Giving the bill to</i> <span class="smcap">Matt</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Aren't you glad, Doll, that you made that resolution not to
have any more bills?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> It will be heavenly! To go about all day with the blessed
thought that I don't owe a farthing to anybody. It's awful!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Crunching a bill in her hand, and throwing it on to
writing-table.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Cheer up, little woman! You don't owe such a very alarming
amount, do you?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh no! Oh <i>no</i>! And if you'll only help me as you promised&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> We'll go thoroughly into it by-and-by. In fact I did mean to
give you a pleasant little Christmas surprise, and pay off all your
debts.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh, you angel! But why didn't you do it?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I've done it so often! You remember the last time?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Making a wry face.</i>] Yes, I remember the last time.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> And here we are again!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh, don't talk like a clown!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> But, my dear Dolly, here we are again.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Well, I haven't got the money sense! I simply haven't got it! I
was born without it!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Hands her the bill.</i>] The addition is quite correct.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Taking the bill.</i>] You're sure? Then I'm convinced I've paid
it! [<i>Looking at bill.</i>] Yes!
Thirty-four, seven, six. Professor
Sturgess&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> [<i>Looks up from his book</i>] Yes?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You understand all about psychology and the way our brains
work.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> I've given my entire life to their study, but I cannot claim
that I understand them.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> But wouldn't you say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I'm morally certain I've paid this bill.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Have you got the receipt?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No! I must have mislaid it.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> When, and where did you pay it?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I cannot recall the exact circumstances. And now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> And now&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Fulks and Garner have sent me a most impertinent note
requesting immediate payment.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> What is the particular brain process that you wish me to
explain?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> How do you account for my having the most vivid impression that
I've paid it&mdash;so vivid that I cannot shake it off?</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Well&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Isn't it an instance of that obscure operation of the feminine
mind whereby the merest wish becomes an accomplished fact?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> My dear Dad, I actually remember the exact amount:
<a name="corr2" id="corr2"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn2" title="changed from 'thirt-four'">thirty-four</a>,
seven, six.
Thirty-four, seven, six. I shall never enter Fulks and

<p><i>Matt.</i> A dozen miles over here at midnight; an hour's service in a cold
church; and a dozen miles back to Aldershot, in the sleet and snow. I
hope the sermon thoroughly braced you up!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> It did. It made me feel just as good as I knew how to be.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Here's another score for Pilcher!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Dad, I think it's shocking bad taste of you to keep on sneering
at Mr. Pilcher!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I'm not sneering. I'm only curious to follow up this wonderful
sermon, and trace its results on all of you.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Well, you can see its results. [<span class="smcap">Lucas</span> <i>has got near to</i> <span class="smcap">Renie</span>,
<i>stands with his back to her, takes out a letter from his coat-tail
pocket, holds it out for her to take. She takes it, pops it in her
novel, and goes on reading. He moves away from her.</i>] Take only our own
family. Harry and I both have turned over a new leaf. Renie, you said
Mr. Pilcher had set you thinking deeply&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Yes, dear, very deeply.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Lu, you said the sermon had done you a lot of good.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Heaps! I won't say I'm going to set up for a saint straight
off, because&mdash;well&mdash;I'm not so sure I could bring it off, even if I
tried&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> That's what holds me back, my wretched nervous fear that I
shouldn't bring it off. Still, in justice to Pilcher, I hope you're not
going to let his sermon be wasted.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Oh, no! My first spare five minutes I'm going to brisk about,
and do a bit of New Year's tidying up.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> How are you?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Good morning, Mr. Pilcher.</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> [<i>Shaking hands.</i>] Good morning.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Rattling good sermon you gave us last night.</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> I'm glad you thought it worth coming so far to hear.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Not at all. Jolly well worth coming for, eh, Mrs. Sturgess?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>With a sly little look and shake of the head at</i> <span class="smcap">Renie</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Renie.</i> I thoroughly enjoyed it!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> [<i>A little surprised.</i>] Enjoyed it! Now I meant to make you
all very uncomfortable!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh, you gave us a good shaking up, and we deserved it! I don't
think you've met Professor Sturgess?</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> [<i>Advancing to</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span>.] No, but I've read his book, "Man,
the Automaton."</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> [<i>Bowing.</i>] Not with disapproval, I trust?</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> [<i>Shaking hands very cordially.</i>] With the most profound
disapproval, with boundless, uncompromising dissent and antagonism!</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> I'm sorry!</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> Why, you deny that man has any vestige of free will.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Certainly. The longer I live, the more I'm convinced that free
will is a purely subjective illusion.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Do you mean that when I will to do a certain thing I can't do
it? Oh, that's absurd. For instance, I will to go and touch that chair!
[<i>She goes and touches it.</i>] There! [<i>Triumphantly.</i>] I've done it! That
shows I've got free will. [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>shakes his head.</i>] Well,
then how did I do it?</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> I affirm that your willing to touch that chair or not to touch
it, your actual touching it, or not touching it; your possession or
non-possession of a criminal impulse&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I haven't any criminal impulses&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> [<i>Shakes his head and goes on.</i>] Your yielding to that criminal
impulse or your not yielding to it&mdash;all these states of consciousness
are entirely dependent upon the condition, quantity and arrangement of
certain atoms in the gray matter of your brain. You think, you will, you
act according as that gray matter works. You did not cause or make that
condition of the atoms of your gray matter, therefore you are not
responsible for thinking or acting in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> way or that, seeing that
your thoughts, and your actions, and that direction of your impulses
which you call your will, are all precisely determined and regulated by
the condition and arrangement of these minute atoms of your gray matter!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Has at first listened with great attention, but has grown
bewildered as the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>goes on.</i>] I don't care anything about my
gray matter! I've quite made up my mind I won't have any more bills!</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> [<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Renie</span>.] Does Mrs. Sturgess agree with the
Professor's doctrine?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> No, indeed! To say that we're mere machines&mdash;it's horrid.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> The question is not whether it's horrid, but whether it's true.</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> What do you think, Mr. Barron?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> It's a very nutty and knotty problem. I'm watching to see Dolly
and Harry solve it!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> See us solve it! How?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> You and Harry heard a most thrilling, soul-stirring sermon last
night.</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> You had good hearsay accounts of my sermon?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Excellent! I should have heard it myself, but I've reached an
age when it would be dangerous to give up any of my old and cherished
bad habits. So in place of going to church and selfishly reforming
myself, I shall have to be content with watching Dolly and Harry reform
themselves.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Don't take any notice of him, Mr. Pilcher, he's the most
cynical, hardened reprobate! I have to blush for him a hundred times a
day.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Renie</span> <i>strolls casually into conservatory by lower door.</i> <span class="smcap">Lucas</span>
<i>casually follows her.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Matt.</i> And in order to settle once and for all this vexed question of
free will and moral responsibility,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> I'll bet you, Harry, a simple
fiver, and I'll bet you Dolly, a new Parisian hat, and half a dozen
pairs of gloves that you won't live up to your good resolutions, and
that on next New Year's Day you'll neither of you be one ha'penny the
better for all the wise counsels Mr. Pilcher gave you last night.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> A fiver! Done!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I'll take you, too! In fact, I'll double it; two new Parisian
hats, and a dozen pairs of gloves!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Done, my dear!</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> I hope I sha'n't be accused of talking shop if I venture to
recall that betting was one of the bad habits I especially warned my
congregation against, last night!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> By Jove, yes&mdash;I'd forgotten all about that! Of course, if you
wish us to cry off&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> Well, not exactly. I might perhaps suggest an alternative
plan which was tried with great success in my late parish&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> What was that?</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> A very capital good fellow&mdash;an auctioneer and land surveyor,
my churchwarden in fact, by name Jobling&mdash;found that in spite of
constant good resolutions, certain small vices were gradually creeping
upon him. There was an occasional outburst of temper to his clerks, an
occasional half glass too much; and on one lamentable market day, he
actually discovered himself using bad language to Mrs. Jobling&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span>.] Oh! Ah!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Jobling's gray matter can't have been in good working order.</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> We corrected that! We got his gray matter under control.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> How?</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> My Christmas Blanket Club happened to be on the road to
bankruptcy. By the way, our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> Blanket Club here is in low water. Well, I
gave Jobling a small box with a hole at the top sufficiently large to
admit half a crown. And I suggested that whenever he was betrayed into
one of these little slips, he should fine himself for the benefit of my
Blanket Club&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Good business! Dolly, where's that collecting-box they sent us
from the Hospital for Incurables?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> In the cupboard in the next room.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Right-o! No time like the present! [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> And how did you get out of this dilemma?</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> Dilemma?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Did your Blanket Club remain in bankruptcy, or what must have
been an even more distressing alternative to you, did Jobling continue
to use bad language to his wife?</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> We struck a happy medium. My Blanket Club balance was
considerably augmented, and Jobling's behaviour considerably improved
under the stress of the fines.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>with an old, dusty collecting-box on which is printed
in large letters, "County Hospital for Incurables."</i></div>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Placing the box on the table.</i>] There! My name's Jobling for
the present! By Jove! that was a very neat idea of yours.</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> Ah, by the way, I didn't give you Jobling's tariff&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Tariff?</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> Jobling's tariff for a mild little profanity like "By Jove,"
was a mere sixpence.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh! [<i>Feels in his pocket.</i></p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> Of course you needn't adopt Jobling's scale.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh yes! I'll toe the mark! [<i>Takes six pence out of his pocket
and puts it in his box.</i>] I'm determined I'll cure myself of all these
bad little tricks&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span>, <i>pointing to the money-box.</i>] Are you going to
contribute?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Snappishly.</i>] Perhaps, when I've paid off my bills.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Pilcher</span>.] Will you kindly let my daughter have your lowest
tariff for ladies?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh, please don't be in such a hurry. What about your own
contribution? Mr. Pilcher, I hope you don't intend to let my father
escape.</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> I understood Mr. Barron was prepared to risk a five-pound
note that you and Mr. Telfer will not carry your New Year resolutions
into practice?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> With the almost certain chance of drawing a five-pound note from
Harry and a new hat from Dolly.</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> I'm afraid I can't hold out those inducements. But I can
offer you the very pleasing alternatives of chuckling over your
daughter's and Mr. Telfer's lapses, or of contributing five pounds to an
excellent charity!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> H'm! Well I'll do my best to oblige you, Mr. Pilcher! Let me
see!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Looking round, his eye falls on</i> <span class="smcap">Renie</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucas</span> <i>who, at the

<p><i>Renie.</i> [<i>Coming to him.</i>] Sport? What sport? Can we join?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> That's just what I was going to propose. There are four of you
here, who heard Mr. Pilcher's excellent discourse last night. And you
are all determined to turn over a new leaf this year. Isn't that so?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Yes, Uncle.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> On the first of January next, I am prepared to put a sovereign
in that money-box for every one of you who can honestly declare that he
has broken himself or herself of his bad habits during the year.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> I say, not all our bad habits?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> H'm. I don't wish to be exacting&mdash;I've no doubt each of

<p><i>Matt.</i> Indeed I do. I hope you won't stand out and&mdash;spoil sport, eh?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Oh, I don't mind coming in&mdash;just for the lark of the thing.</p>

to have a dear, kind husband who'll pay them all off.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Harry? He made a dreadful fuss last time. And then I didn't
show him all.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Well, dear, after all, it's only bills&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Only bills! Only? Well, I'm going to show him every one this
time. And what a lesson it shall be to me! That's why I'm so grateful to
Mr. Pilcher.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Why?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yesterday afternoon I thought I'd screw up my courage to go
through the bills just to see where I was. My dear, I was paralysed! I
had the most appalling time! Well, Mr. Pilcher's sermon came just in the
nick of time. I thought "what an idiot I must be to endure all this
misery just for want of a little resolution."</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Mr. Pilcher's sermon came just in the nick of time for me too.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Did it?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> I had an awful afternoon yesterday!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You?! You haven't any bills?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> No! [<i>Sighs.</i>] I almost wish I had.</p>

confess&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes dear, you always were fond of scenes, but I'm not!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> And then the heavenly feeling of being forgiven, and taken in
the arms of the man you love!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes, that part of it is all right. It's what comes before&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>With a little shudder.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Renie.</i> After all, your husband isn't a machine. He is a human being!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh, Harry's a perfect dear in most things, but he has got a
temper!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> My husband never even swears at me! Oh, Dolly, you are lucky!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Hum!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Oh, Dolly&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Sighs and goes away.</i></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Is anything the matter?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> No dear. Nothing, except&mdash;oh, life is so hard! so hard!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Renie, if you're in trouble&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Thank you, dear. I knew you'd help me.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes, so long as it isn't money. And even then I'd help you,
only I can't.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> It isn't money.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Then what is it?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> [<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>curiously.</i>] I wonder if you would
understand.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I'll do my best.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> It's such a strange story. [<i>Moving away,</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>makes a
little dubious grimace behind her back.</i> <span class="smcap">Renie</span> <i>suddenly comes up to</i>
<span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>very effusively.</i>] Dolly, I will trust you. You know I thoroughly
admire and honour my husband.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>A little startled.</i>] Ye-es.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> You know that nothing could ever induce me to wrong him for a
moment?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Nothing could be further from my thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No&mdash;but is there anybody&mdash;Renie, who is it?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Give me your sacred promise you'll never breathe a word to any
living soul?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Not a word&mdash;who is it?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Not even to your husband?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Not even to my husband.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Nor to him?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Him? No, of course not. Who is it?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Well, dear, you know what my life has been. Few women have met
with so little real sympathy as I. Few women have suffered&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No, dear. Who is it? Do I know him?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Your cousin Lucas has a deep and sincere admiration for me.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Lu!? Lu!? Of course! I might have known he'd never ride a dozen
miles in the snow for a sermon! It's disgraceful of him!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> No, dear, he's not to blame. We are neither of us to blame.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Contemptuously.</i>] Oh! Why you haven't known him a month, have
you?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> I met him for the first time in this room three weeks ago last
Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> It's a great pity the Professor didn't come down with you.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> That would have made no difference. It had to be!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> What had to be? Renie, how far has this gone? You've been
meeting him alone&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Once or twice.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You've slipped away every afternoon this week.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> However often I may have met him, he has offered me nothing but
the most chivalrous attention. He has always respected me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Well then, he mustn't respect you any more. It must be stopped.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Dolly, I didn't expect you to take up this attitude.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You don't suppose I'm going to have this sort of thing in my
own house, do you?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> What sort of thing?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Do you remember the awful row I got into at school when your
boy's love letter was discovered in the Banbury cakes you'd persuaded me
to take in for you?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> But you received Banbury cakes of your own!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Not since I've been married. Of course before your marriage
your outrageous flirting didn't much matter&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Outrageous flirting?&mdash;If I seemed to flirt&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Seemed?!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> It was only in the vain hope of meeting with one who could
offer me the perfect homage that I have always felt would one day be
mine.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Well, he mustn't offer it here! I shall tell him so very
plainly. He'd better not stay to dinner.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> There is no reason Captain Wentworth should not stay to dinner.
He has given me the one absolutely blameless unselfish devotion of his
life. I've accepted it on that distinct understanding. I've trusted you
with my secret, a secret honourable alike to Captain Wentworth and
myself. You've promised not to breathe a word to any living soul. You
surely don't mean to break your word?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I don't mean to stand the racket of your Banbury cakes.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> I didn't expect you to be so unsympathetic. You promised to
help me!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Help you! How did you expect me to help you?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> My husband has to go to Edinburgh next week to give a course of
lectures there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Well?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> He wants me to go with him. Dearest, it would be perfectly
sweet of you to ask me to stay on another fortnight here.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Makes a little movement of indignant surprise.</i>] I see!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> There could be no possible harm in it now that you know our
attachment is quite innocent and that you can look after me every
moment. Dearest, you might oblige me in a tiny little matter like this.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>After a pause.</i>] I'll think it over&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Thank you so much.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Renie, you said Mr. Pilcher's sermon came just in the nick of
time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> So it did.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You don't call this the "nick of time"?!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Yes, indeed. I went to church in a perfect fever. I didn't know
what to do. Well, as I listened to Mr. Pilcher everything became quite
clear to me. I resolved I would accept Captain Wentworth's pure
unselfish devotion and make it a lever to raise all my ideals and
aspirations!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> But there wasn't anything in Mr. Pilcher's sermon about&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Oh yes, there was a lot about ideals and aspirations.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes, but not the sort of aspirations you have for Lucas. I
suppose you know he makes love to every woman he comes across?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> He told me he had been led into one or two unworthy
attachments.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes! That's quite right. So he has! One or two!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> That was before he met me.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes, and this will be before he meets the next lady.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> [<i>Looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>severely.</i>] My dear Dolly, with your light
frivolous nature it is impossible for you to understand a pure and
exalted attachment like ours. Listen! [<i>Taking out a letter.</i>] This will
show you his fine nature, his fine feelings&mdash;"From the first moment I
saw you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Matt</span> <i>enters.</i></div>

<p><i>Renie.</i> [<i>Putting letter in pocket.</i>] Well, have you had a
<a name="corr4" id="corr4"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn4" title="changed from 'plesant'">pleasant</a>
walk?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Very pleasant&mdash;and instructive. The Professor asked me to remind
you that he's waiting for you at the fish-pond.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> I'd better go. I shall get a little lecture all to myself if I
don't. [<i>Going off, to</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly.</span>] Thank you, dear, so much for your kind
invitation to stay on!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Don't mention it!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> I shall try to manage it. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes, I'm sure you will.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Mrs. Sturgess going to stay on?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> She wants me to invite her. But I won't if I can help it.
[<i>Goes to him suddenly.</i>] Dad!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Well?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> That wretched Lucas!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> What about him?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No, I've promised her not to breathe a word. So you must guess.
[<i>Pause.</i>] Have you guessed?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>After a pause.</i>] Yes. Well, I&mdash;[<i>Begins to chuckle.</i>] So Lucas
is up to his old games!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> My own guest! Under my own roof! It's too horrid of him.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Chuckling.</i>] It is! It's too bad! The rascal.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh, it's more than half her fault! It's just like her!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Matt</span> <i>suddenly bursts from a chuckle into a roar.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> What are you laughing at?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I've just left&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Chuckling.</i>] I've just left the Professor
down at the fish-pond explaining to Lucas all about his gray matter,
and&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Roars.</i></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I don't see anything to laugh at.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Twelve miles in the snow&mdash;&mdash; I say, Doll, we're making a
splendid start for the New Year! [<i>Laughing.</i></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Dad! Will you please leave off? [<i>Shaking his shoulder.</i>] Will
you be serious?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Yes, my dear!! [<i>Pulling himself together and straightening his
features.</i>] Yes, I will. After all, it's a serious matter.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> It's very serious for me, in a neighbourhood like this!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> It's serious for me, as I was Lucas's guardian. And it's serious
for him. If he goes and plays the fool, it may spoil his career&mdash;the
young ass!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Very well, then, will you please treat it seriously and set to
work and help me?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> How far have matters gone?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh, there's no real harm done at present.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> How do you know?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh, Lucas is writing her silly letters and she's talking about
his pure and exalted devotion, and making it a lever to raise all her
ideals and aspirations.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Shakes his head.</i>] That looks bad! That looks very dangerous
for her.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh, no; she knows how to take care of herself. But it's
dangerous for me!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> How, dangerous for you?!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> If there's the least bit of scandal she'll contrive to drag me
into it! I know her so well.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Walking about, cogitating.</i>] Yes, and we mustn't let Lucas
make a mess of it.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> What can we do?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> When I was over at Aldershot last week Sir John said something
about giving Lucas an A. D. C. in India. I'll drive over to-morrow and
ask Sir John to pack Lucas out of the country for a year or two!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> That's a good idea. But it may take some time?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> A week or so, perhaps more.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> But if they find out they're going to be parted, it is just
this next week when there will be all the danger.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> That's true.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> They ought to be parted to-night.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> They ought! They ought! Not a doubt about it! Not a shadow of
doubt! They ought to be parted to-night!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Dad! I believe I can frighten Renie out of it.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Frighten her?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I'll try! And you must take Lucas in hand&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> H'm! Isn't Harry the right person&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No, I sha'n't tell Harry. Harry would only get into a temper
and muddle it. No, you must get Lucas to take himself off.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Take himself off!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I won't have him here. You can tell him so. Be very severe with
him.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Dubious.</i>] H'm!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Take a very high tone.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I'm not sure that taking a high tone is quite in my line.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Then please try it. Dad, you do realize how very serious this
is, don't you?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Yes, of course. Very well, I'll tackle Lucas. We'll see what a
high tone will do with him. Heigho! Sad! Sad!! Sad!!!&mdash;Sad! Sad!!

into other people's affairs, but you see it has been forced upon his
notice. And from the tone he took&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> What tone?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> He was very severe.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> [<i>Alarmed.</i>] But what did he say he had seen?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Perhaps. What happened? No, I don't wish to hear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Captain Wentworth assisted me over the stile&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Well?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> That's all. He may have taken a little longer about it than was
quite necessary, and I may have leaned a little heavier than the
circumstances required. But it was all done in perfectly good taste.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Shakes her head.</i>] It can't have been the stile.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Then what&mdash;&mdash;? [<i>Cudgels her brains.</i>] The dairy!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Very likely. Was that very&mdash;no, don't tell me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> There's nothing to tell. The woman at the farm, Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Biggs, asked me to go over her model dairy.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Did she ask Lucas?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> He came. Mrs. Biggs insisted on our tasting her mince pies&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Mince pies&mdash;? Yes?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> While she went to get one&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Get one&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> [<i>Firing up.</i>] He is always most respectful! In the most
delicate, exquisitely chivalrous way, he implored me for one first and
only kiss, and just as I was refusing him, somebody passed the dairy
windows&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> My father often strolls that way&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Renie.</i> But I was quite cold and correct&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Very anxiously.</i>]
Dolly, tell me exactly what Mr. Barron said?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> At first he was going to speak to you himself, but I said, "No,
that's my duty! I'm her oldest friend; I'll talk to her!"</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Ye&mdash;es?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> So, at last he consented, and said: "Very well. Be very firm
with her, because this sort of thing taking place under my very nose and
under my daughter's roof is what I cannot, and will not, tolerate for
one moment!"</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> He must have passed the dairy windows!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> About what?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Didn't you notice something strange in your husband's manner at
dinner?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> No. What makes you think&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

windows.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Of course I'll tell him, but if he saw&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> But there was nothing. Absolutely nothing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No, dear. What else can I do?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Could you find out exactly how much he has seen and heard,

at a more cruel moment.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No, dear.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No, dear, perhaps not. But, you see, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> husbands they take
quite a different view of things from what they do merely as men.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Tell me candidly, Dolly, you see nothing wrong in it, do you?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Well, dear, when you say wrong&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> But I assure you there isn't&mdash;nothing could be further from my
thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No, dear&mdash;still, people are so full of prejudice&mdash;now what can
I do?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> [<i>Clasping</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly's</span> <i>hand warmly.</i>] Oh, Dolly, you can help me
so much.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>A little alarmed.</i>] Can I? Tell me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> If Lucas and I are parted&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Breaks down.</i>] I can't bear it!
I can't bear it!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Try, dear! Try!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> [<i>Sobbing.</i>] I will. And if at any time I long to hear how he
bears our separation, you won't mind receiving a letter, and sending it
on to me?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I'm afraid I couldn't do that, dear. You see, I'm so careless,
and if I left the letter about, and Harry found it&mdash;no, dear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> You won't help me?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes, dear, I'll do anything in my power! [<i>Suddenly.</i>] I'll
tell you what I can do!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Yes?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> My father is telling Lucas he must leave to-night. Well, I can
spare you all the pain and misery of saying "Good-bye," and take one
last message to him.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> [<i>Curtly.</i>] No, thank you. It's most unkind of you to send him
away like this. I must see him alone before he goes.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Shakes her head.</i>] My father insists, and suppose Lucas feels
that he owes it to your reputation to go quietly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Without seeing me?!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> And suppose the Professor is really watching you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Renie</span> shows great perplexity. <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>is watching her.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> If you don't see Lucas, what message shall I take him?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Tell him how proud I am of his noble, unselfish devotion; tell
him I shall always look upon it as the one supreme happiness of my life
to have known him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

he enters, and is showing him an illustration.</i></div>

<p><i>Prof.</i> [<i>In his hard, metallic voice.</i>] Observe that woman's facial
angle&mdash;[<i>pointing</i>] the peculiar curve of the lip, and the irregular
formation of the nose.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Describing a little upward curve on the paper with his thumb.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I have seen sweeter things in ladies' lips and noses.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Describing the same little upward curve with his thumb on the

<p><i>Prof.</i> Can you be surprised at her history?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Who was she?</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Jane Sweetman, the notorious trigamist. Looking at that woman's
cranium I maintain it was impossible for her to avoid&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Committing trigamy?</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Well, some species of grave moral delinquency.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>clutches</i> <span class="smcap">Renie's</span> <i>wrist significantly. The</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Has examined the illustration.</i>] By Jove, yes&mdash;anybody can

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He hands the illustration to</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span>, <i>who passes it to</i> <span class="smcap">Renie</span>,

<span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>to look at the illustration. As he leans on the back of the

<p><i>Prof.</i> [<i>Bringing out another illustration, offering it to</i> <span class="smcap">Matt</span>.] Now
look at this.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Taking illustration.</i>] Somebody's brains!</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Tell me if you notice anything peculiar.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>leans over</i> <span class="smcap">Matt's</span> <i>shoulder, and looks at the

<p><i>Lucas.</i> So that's Jane Sweetman! Well, if Jane<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> was bound to come a
moral cropper, I'm very glad I wasn't bound to come a moral cropper with
Jane, eh, Dolly? [<i>Very pleasantly.</i></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Very severely.</i>] I should scarcely have thought you troubled
whom you came a moral cropper with!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Looks at him severely, goes up to writing-desk, seats herself and

<p><i>Prof.</i> Well, does anything strike you?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> No. [<i>Holding it out.</i>] Looks rather
pulpy&mdash;rather&mdash;a&mdash;squashy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Exactly! Observe the soft, almost watery condition of that gray
matter. What is the inevitable consequence?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I couldn't quite say&mdash;whom did that gray matter belong to?</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Harriet Poy.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I don't remember Harriet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> The Pyromaniac. At the age of four set fire to her mother's bed.
At twelve was found saturating blankets with petroleum; at sixteen fired
three hayricks, for which she was sentenced to six months' imprisonment.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Poor Harriet! But of course if her gray matter went and got
watery&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Just so! I maintain that with her gray matter in that condition
it was a stupid crime to send her to prison.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Looking round from desk.</i>] But what are we to do with people
whose gray matter goes wrong?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> I propose to deal with that question at Edinburgh. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Matt</span>.]
You might, perhaps, care to run down to Edinburgh for my lectures&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I should love it above all things; but the fact is, I'm so
thoroughly of your opinion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Are you?! I'm delighted I've convinced you.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Completely. All my life I've been doing things I should never
have dreamed of doing if my gray matter had done its duty and not got
watery.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Begins.</i>] Yes, when you come to think of all the rotten
things you find yourself doing, you feel, by Jove&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Suddenly recalls that he has said "by Jove," and being near the

<p><i>Matt.</i> Bravo, Harry! [<i>Patting him.</i></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh, I mean it!&mdash;Professor, isn't it time for our hundred up?</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> [<i>Taking out watch.</i>] In two minutes.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I'll go and get the balls out and chalk the cues. [<i>Going up to
door.</i>] Doll, [<i>taps the writing-desk</i>] you put it off after
tea&mdash;by-and-by, you know!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>She has finished letter, has risen, and closed
writing-desk.</i>] By-and-by.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Before we go to bed&mdash;don't forget.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh, I sha'n't forget.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Makes a wry face. Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Renie, you were complaining of headache. It would be wise to
take a short stroll in the cool air.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Oh, very well.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Wrap up thoroughly. Ten minutes, not longer.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh, Renie! I'll put on my things, and come with you.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> But Captain Wentworth has offered&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I've a splitting headache&mdash;I must get a little air. And Dad
wants to have a talk with Lucas, don't you?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> If he can spare five minutes.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Won't by-and-by be just as convenient?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Facing</i> <span class="smcap">Lucas</span>, <i>speaking firmly.</i>] No, by-and-by will not be
just as convenient. Now, Renie, we'll leave them together.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Gets</i> <span class="smcap">Renie</span> <i>off, turns, looks daggers at</i> <span class="smcap">Lucas</span>, <i>goes off

her.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> I say, Doll, what's up? [<i>Follows her off.</i>] What's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Reading</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly's</span> <i>note.</i>] "Be very severe with him. Make a
great point of the dairy windows. He'll understand." Dairy windows?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Puts the note in his pocket, as</i> <span class="smcap">Lucas</span> <i>re-enters, puzzled and
disappointed.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> I can't think what's the matter with Dolly. She has done
nothing but snub me all the evening.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Looking at him sternly.</i>] So I should imagine!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> [<i>Startled by his manner.</i>] I say, have I done anything?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Done anything! I'm a man of the world! nobody can accuse me of
being strait-laced, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> therefore I suppose you think you can come here
and set at defiance all the&mdash;&mdash;it's disgraceful!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Would you mind telling me what you're hinting at?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I'm not hinting! I'm going to speak out very plainly, and I tell
you that I look upon your conduct as something atrocious!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> I say, Uncle, what's all this about?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> What's it about? What's it about? It's about the dairy windows!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Then it was you&mdash;phew!&mdash;so it was you?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Well, after the dairy windows, can you stand there and tell me
you aren't thoroughly, completely, heartily ashamed of yourself?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Well, I suppose I am. But, after all, it wasn't so very bad&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Not bad?!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Well, not so d&mdash;ee&mdash;d awful.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Regards him for a few moments.</i>] Well, I'm astonished! If you
don't consider your behaviour d&mdash;ee&mdash;d awful, will you please find me
some word that will describe it?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> You know you're putting a much worse construction on this than
the necessities of the case demand.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> What?!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> I've nothing to reproach myself with. Mrs. Biggs wasn't out of
the dairy three minutes, and you were hanging about the windows all the
time.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I was hanging about the windows?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Yes, and I must say that when you saw two people engaged in an
interesting conversation the least you could do was to pass on and take
no notice.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> "Interesting conversation"?!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Well, what did you call it? If it comes to that, what do you
accuse me of?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Well, here you are, on the first day of the year, after
listening to a most eloquent sermon, after making a solemn resolution to
give up all your bad habits&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Excuse me, I expressly stated that I didn't mean to give up
<i>all</i> my bad habits. And I don't call this a bad habit.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> You don't call making love to a married woman a bad habit?!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Of course in one sense it is a bad habit. But it isn't a bad
habit in the sense that other bad habits are bad habits. Look at all the
decent chaps who've been led into it!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> That doesn't excuse you. And if you think that I'm going to
countenance your conduct, you are very much mistaken in your estimate of
my character.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> [<i>Very quietly.</i>] May I ask you one simple question?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Well?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> When you were my age, if you found yourself alone in a dairy
with a good-looking woman, and she was good for a dozen kisses or so,
wouldn't you have taken advantage of it?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> No!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Not at my age?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> No&mdash;no&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Well, what would you have done?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I should have summoned all my resolution&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Oh, that be hanged! Come, Uncle, no humbug! Man to man!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Well, I don't say that at your age I might not have been
tempted&mdash;and of course we must all go through a certain amount of
experience, or how should we be able to advise you youngsters?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> I say, no confounded nonsense&mdash;your uncle Archie&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Dear old chap!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> What use did you make of his advice?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Well, I remember his talking to me very seriously&mdash;I suppose I
was about your age&mdash;did I ever tell you, Lucas, [<i>taking</i> <span class="smcap">Lucas's</span> <i>arm
affectionately</i>] about a very remarkable auburn-haired girl, Madge
Seaforth?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> And my racing her across Salisbury Plain at night?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Forty-eight miles one glorious May night! I let her beat me! God
bless her! I let her beat me! And just as the sun rose we caught sight
of Salisbury spire.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Sounds rather jolly!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Jolly? And the bacon and eggs we got through for breakfast!
Jolly? It was romance! It was poetry! Ah! Lu, my boy, you may say what
you like, there's nothing like it on this side heaven. I told you about
Mrs. Satterwaite dressing up as a widow and selling her husband?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> No?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Well, I bet the little hussy a fiver. Oh, Satterwaite richly
deserved all he got&mdash;I can see Satterwaite's face now, and hers, as she
stepped out of the cupboard, with the wickedest twinkle in the wickedest
black eye! Ho! Ho! Heigho! Sad! Sad!! Sad!!!&mdash;Sad! Sad!! Sad!!! Come,
come, Lucas! This won't do! This will never do! Now to get back to this
business of yours&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> When I was your guardian I let you have a pretty good fling?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> You did!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> The pace was rather scorching?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Rather!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I never pulled you up?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> No, and I'm grateful.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Shaking hands very cordially.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Matt.</i> That's all right. Now, old chap, you've got to pull up!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Pull up?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Short. This Mrs. Sturgess&mdash;Dolly says there's a lot of nonsense
going on, gushing letters and so on,&mdash;damned silly thing writing
letters, Lu&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Yes, I know.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Well, what do you do it for?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> I don't know.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> You're seeing her every day. If you must carry on this
tomfoolery, why not do it by word of mouth? Why write it down, to show
what an ass you've been?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> I'm sure I don't know.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Do you know why you're carrying on with her at all?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Well, naturally a chap&mdash;naturally&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> You're either in love with her, or you aren't?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> I can't say I'm exactly in love with her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Then why are you making love to her?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Well, she's a jolly good-looking woman, and naturally a
chap&mdash;naturally&mdash;I don't know that I ain't a bit in love with her.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Well, it doesn't much matter. If you aren't in love with her
you're a fool to risk a scandal. If you are in love you'll most likely
do some silly jackass thing that will knock your career on the head, eh?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Well, when you look at it that way&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Look at it that way! Anyhow, she's a married woman, and you're
here as a guest&mdash;it isn't the right thing to do, is it?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> No, it isn't.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Very well, then, don't do it. Don't do it! Cut it! You will?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> I've got to, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Yes, you've got to. You can tell Doll I gave it to you hot and
strong, and you're going to clear out, and not see Mrs. Sturgess
again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Not see her again?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Isn't that what you mean to do?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Yes, I suppose. I say, what did you see at the dairy windows?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I didn't see anything at all!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Nothing at all?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I wasn't there!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Then how&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Dolly put me up to it. [<i>Laughs at him.</i></p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Dolly?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>enters with a cloak which she throws on sofa.</i></div>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Ah, Doll&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Looking severely at</i> <span class="smcap">Lucas</span>.] Have you spoken to him?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Yes, very seriously, extra seriously, and he's going to do the
right thing and clear out, aren't you, Lucas?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> [<i>A little unwillingly.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Clapping him on the shoulder.</i>] Good chap! Good chap!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Still a little severe.</i>] I'm pleased to hear it. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Lucas</span>.] You've behaved in a most scandalous&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> He has. I've told him all that. [<i>Winks at</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>to keep her
quiet.</i>] And he sees it quite plainly, don't you?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Winks at</i> <span class="smcap">Lucas</span> <i>to
prompt him.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Then it's quite broken off?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Quite! Isn't it, Lu?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Yes, I suppose. I should like to say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> That nothing has taken place which, if rightly looked at, could
reflect discredit either upon the lady, or, I hope, upon myself. And
secondly, whatever fault there may have been, is entirely mine.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> That's satisfactory! It always ought to be the man's fault.
Heaven forbid it should ever be theirs. Good chap! Good chap! [<i>Patting
him.</i>] Dolly, he's behaving splendidly. Now, Lu, good-night.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>rings bell.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> [<i>Surprised.</i>] Good-night?!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Good-night, and good-bye! [<i>Holding out her hand.</i></p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> You aren't going to turn me out to-night!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You said it was quite broken off.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Yes, but&mdash;&mdash; [<i>turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Matt</span> <i>with appealing gesture.</i> Uncle,
you didn't mean to pack me off like this&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Yes, my boy! Remember the occasion. First day of the New Year.
Take time by the forelock. Off you go!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Taking him by the shoulder and trying to get him off.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Yes, on their sofa! You needn't look so black! I asked you
first, to let me have a shake-down here&mdash;on that sofa&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> But why have you come back here?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Well, I must have dropped those cigars uncle Matt gave me. I
put them carefully in my side pocket, and when I got down to the Red
Lion, lo and behold, they weren't there!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You could have got a cigar at the Red Lion&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> [<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Matt</span> <i>for sympathy.</i>] I could have got a cigar at
the Red Lion! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly.</span>] No, thank you! So I thought I'd just stroll
up here in the hope&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> In the hope of seeing Mrs. Sturgess! But she's safely in bed
this time, and there's no possible chance of your seeing her.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> In the hope of getting Harry to give me a decent smoke. Well, I
came into the Hall and not wishing to rile you by my hated presence&mdash;I
slipped into the conservatory&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Harry.</span></div>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Surprised at the riding-clothes.</i>] Hillo, Lu, going back to
Aldershot to-night?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> No, not unless the weather takes a turn. No, Dolly said that as
the spare room was occupied, would I mind getting a shake-down at the
Red Lion. So I did, and as I've got nothing to smoke, may I cadge a
cigar?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, old fellow. [<i>Taking out cigar-case.</i></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Intercepting.</i>] You said I should take charge of your cigars,
in case you should be tempted to smoke more than two a day&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> By Jove, I forgot all about two per diem&mdash;I've been smoking all
day. Here, Lu! [<i>About to throw cigar-case to</i> <span class="smcap">Lucas.</span>] You'd better take
the lot and keep me out of temptation!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No! I'll take charge of that, please.</p>

<p><i>Peters.</i> When I got back with the hop-pillow she wasn't there. I've

<p><i>Prof.</i> Two teaspoonfuls. On certain occasions I have taken as much as
four tablespoonfuls.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Wasn't that rather&mdash;going it?</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> No. It's quite tasteless, except for a very slight beany
flavor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No, my darling. You put it off after tea&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> But our heads will be so much clearer in the morning&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Very solemnly and severely.</i>] My darling, remember what
Pilcher said about procrastination. And remember our resolutions last
night. If we break them on the first night of the year, where shall we
be on the thirty-first of December?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I'm horribly fagged.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Conquer it! Think how delightful it will be to put your head on
the pillow to-night, without a single anxiety, without a single
thought&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Except my gratitude to you!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Come, dear, no time like the present!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Jumps up very briskly.</i>] No time like the present! [<i>Looking
at him with great admiration.</i>] Oh, Harry, what a dear, kind, good

<p><i>Harry.</i> Have I, my darling? [<i>Modestly.</i>] I've done my best&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> How I must have tried you!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No, dear&mdash;at least a little sometimes.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> When I think what patience you've had with me, and never
reproached me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Well, not often. We've had our little tiffs&mdash;That day at
Goodwood&mdash;eh?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Don't speak of it! I was to blame&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No, dear, I can't let you accuse yourself. I was quite in the

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No, dear, it was my fault entirely!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Well, we won't quarrel about that. Now these bills&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> And always shall be. [<i>Kissing her.</i></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Hugging him.</i>] Oh, you dear!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Now, business, business!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Going up to writing-desk.</i>] What a lucky woman I am!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Seated at table.</i>] Bring them all.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Has opened desk and taken up some bills&mdash;she looks round
dubiously at</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span>.] What a splendid thing it must be to be a husband
and have it in your power to make your wife <i>adore</i> you, by simply
paying a few bills.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes&mdash;bring them all. [<i>She comes down with a bundle of about
fifteen, hands them to him.</i>] Is this all?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> All, of any importance.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I want to see them all.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> So you shall, but we'll go through these first, because
[<i>lamely</i>] if you want to ask any questions we can settle them on the
spot, can't we?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Reading from the bill.</i>] Maison R&eacute;camier, Court and artistic
millinery. By Jove! [<i>Looks up.</i></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> What!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine&mdash;nine
hats!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Different kinds of hats.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yedda straw hat, four guineas, ostrich feather ruffle, twelve
pounds ten&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> That was the one&mdash;you remember&mdash;when I came into the room you
said, "Stay there! Just as you are! I must kiss you!"</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, but twelve pounds ten&mdash;Moss green chip hat, four,
fourteen, six. Heliotrope velvet toque&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> That's the dear little toque you admire so much!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Do I? Six guineas! Dear little toque! Hat in white Tegal with
plumes of Nattier Bleu&mdash;fifteen guineas&mdash;Fifteen guineas?!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> With plumes! Of Nattier Bleu!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> But fifteen guineas!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh, the woman's a fearful swindler! But what are you to do with
such people?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>With bill.</i>] Total, sixty-four, seven, six. And I get my one
silk topper a year, at a guinea, and three and six for doing it up.
Total for me, one, four, six. Total for you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> My dear Harry, don't make absurd comparisons!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Takes another bill.</i>] John Spearman, artistic gown maker,
ball gowns, reception gowns, race gowns&mdash;Good heavens!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> What's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Total, five hundred and fifty-six pounds&mdash;that can't be right!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Frightened.</i>] No, it can't be! Add it up!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Reading.</i>] Tea gown of chiffon taffeta&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> The one I took to Folkestone, you remember?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>With a little
attempt at a kiss.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Gently repulsing her.</i>] No, I don't. [<i>She puts her arms
round his neck; he gently pushes her aside.</i>] Business first, please.
[<i>Reads.</i>] Gown of white cloth with Postillion coat of Rose du Barri
silk, motifs of silver, forty-five guineas&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You won't grumble at that, for when I first put it on, you
stood and looked at me and said, "I want to know how it is, Doll, that
the moment a dress gets on to your shoulders, it seems to brisk up, and
be as cocky and proud of itself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Again attempting to embrace

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Again repulsing her.</i>] Yes, well now I do know! Jolly proud
and cocky your dresses ought to feel at this price! [<i>Reads.</i>] "Evening
cloak of strawberry satin charmeuse, trimmed silk passementerie, motifs
and fringed stoles of dull gold embroidery, thirty-five guineas." What's
a motif?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> It's a trimming&mdash;a lot of little touches&mdash;a sort
of&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;[<i>making a little descriptive gesture</i>] a suggestion&mdash;a
motif&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> And Mr. John Spearman's motif is that I should pay him five
hundred and fifty-six pounds. Well, I don't like Mr. John Spearman's
motifs, and I'm not going to fall in with them. [<i>Puts the bill on the
table rather angrily, takes up another, reads.</i>] "Artistic lingerie!" I
wonder why all these people call themselves artists! "Underwear of
daintiness and distinction."</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Well, you've always praised&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes. In future, I'm going to be very careful what articles of
your dress I praise. "Three pairs of blue silk garters, forty-five
shillings." [<i>She has settled herself in the armchair,
looking a little
sulky and obstinate, leaning back and pettishly swinging one leg over
the other.</i>] What have you got to say to that?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Garters are necessary.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, but why three? And why blue silk? Why don't you speak?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> The garters can speak for
<a name="corr8" id="corr8"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn8" title="changed from 'themselevs'">
themselves</a>!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Very well. Garters that can speak for themselves can pay for
themselves! [<i>Dashes the bill on the table, takes up another. Reading.</i>]
Three bottles c&oelig;ur de Janette&mdash;three bottles Souffle de
Marguerite&mdash;fifteen pounds for scent&mdash;and I have to smoke sixpenny
cigars! And sometimes only fourpenny!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Well, if you will smoke those horrid strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> things you can't
wonder I have to disinfect the house for you.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Disinfect the house <i>for</i> me! You'll very soon disinfect the
house <i>of</i> me! [<i>Glances through the remaining bills, groans, puts them
on the table, and walks about in despair.</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>rises and is going
off.</i>] Where are you going?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> To bed.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Stopping her.</i>] No! Now we've begun, we'll go through to the
bitter end, if you please. I want you to explain&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> My dear Harry, it will be quite useless for me to try to
explain in your present state&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Getting furious.</i>] In my present state&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Dancing about the room and shouting!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I'm not shouting!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You're not shouting?!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No, and if I am, isn't it enough to make a man shout when his
wife&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Matt</span> <i>appears at the door in his dressing-gown and slippers.</i></div>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Excuse my interrupting. But you know my room is just above this,
and if you could manage to pitch your voices in rather a softer key&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> By Jove, I'd forgotten! We were getting a little noisy. I'm
awfully sorry.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Don't mention it! The Professor gave me rather a stiff go of his
Pableine, and I fancy it hasn't agreed with me [<i>tapping his chest</i>] for
I can't get a wink of sleep. Is there a spoonful of whiskey about?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> On the sideboard in the dining-room.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Thankee. [<i>Tapping his chest.</i>] Harry, when you get over fifty,
don't change your nightcap, or any of your other bad habits.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I won't. Now, Dolly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Anxiously.</i>] You won't perhaps be very long now?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No, we'd nearly finished&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Nothing serious, I hope?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Harry doesn't approve of my using scent.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Not in pailfuls. Certainly not.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I had three small bottles&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Montaigne says that the sweetest perfume a woman can have, is to
have none at all. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Now, my darling, we shall best arrive at an understanding if we
avoid all temper, and discuss it in a calm, business-like way.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>A little frightened.</i>] Ye-es&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Very well then, bring up your chair, and let us go into it,
figure by figure, item by item, and see how we stand.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Ye-es. [<i>Bringing a chair a little way.</i>] Harry, you aren't
going to be as business-like as all that?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> As all what?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I can't discuss it while you keep me at a distance! [<i>Suddenly
rushes at him, seats herself on his knee, puts his arm round her waist,
kisses him.</i>] There! now I feel I can discuss it thoroughly.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Very well [<i>kisses her</i>], so long as we do discuss it
thoroughly.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I began to get quite frightened of you, Mr. Jobling.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Jobling?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> The man Mr. Pilcher had to get a money-box for, because he
swore at his wife!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh, yes.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You got so angry&mdash;and shouted&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Well, there was no reason for that, especially as getting out
of temper is <i>the</i> one thing I'm quite resolved to conquer this New
Year&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Kissing him.</i>] Don't forget that!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Kisses her.</i>] Now, business, business! [<i>Takes up a bill.</i>]
What have we here? Carchet, gantier et bonnetier, artiste&mdash;Hillo, here's
another artist! In stockings this time. [<i>Suddenly.</i>] I say!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Frightened.</i>] Eh?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Points to an item in bill.</i>] Come now, Dolly&mdash;this is really

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Naughty swear word, and getting out of temper.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh well&mdash;[<i>fumbling in his pocket</i>] I did say d&mdash;&mdash;, but I
didn't get out of temper!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You didn't get out of temper?!?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Not at all. I'm quite calm. [<i>Sulkily puts a shilling in the
box.</i>] There! [<i>Seats himself at table.</i>] Now we'll go quietly and
methodically through the remainder&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Taking up a bill, looks at it,
exclaims.</i>] Good heavens!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Good heavens what?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>In a low exhausted tone with groans.</i>] Good heavens! Good
heavens! It's absolutely useless&mdash;Good heavens!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> But what is it? [<i>Coming up, looking over.</i></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Points to bill.</i>] Four more hats! Nine on the other
bill&mdash;four more here. Thirteen hats.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No, one was a toque.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> But can you explain?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes. You said yourself that Madame R&eacute;camier was horribly
expensive, so I left her and went to Jacquelin's&mdash;just to save your
pocket&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Never save my pocket again, please.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Very well, I won't.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No, I daresay you won't, but I shall! I shall draw the strings
very tightly in future. Save my pocket! [<i>He is walking about
distractedly.</i>] Save my pocket. [<i>Groans.</i></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Now, Harry, it's useless to take it in this way&mdash;you knew when
you married me I hadn't got the money sense&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Groans.</i>] I hadn't got any sense at all!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Very likely not. But try and have a little now. What have I
done? Run a little into debt, solely to please you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes; well, now run out of it, and I shall be better pleased
still.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> After all, running into debt is a positive virtue beside the
things that some wives do!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh, it's a positive virtue, is it?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> A husband is very lucky when his wife spends most of her time
running up a few bills. It keeps her out of mischief. I'm sure you ought
to feel very glad that I'm a little extravagant!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh, I am! I am! I'm delighted!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He sits at table, takes out a pencil, hurriedly puts down the

[<i>Groans.</i>] Ninety-four&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Groans.</i></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Has crept up behind him, puts her arms round his neck.</i>] Now,
Harry, will you take my advice&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No.</p>

I shall need from my banker?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Harry, you don't mean that? Oh, that's absurd with our income!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Will you have the goodness to do as I say, and at once, please?
[<i>He is dotting down figures. She stands still in the middle of the

going to be so happy! Harry! [<i>Holds out her arms appealingly.</i>] Harry!
[<span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>suddenly turns round and clasps her.</i>] How could you be so

<p><i>Harry.</i> Was I? I didn't mean to be. Now! Dry your tears, and help me

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Ye-es.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> But first of all let me have the remainder of the bills&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> At once, my darling&mdash;it's getting late.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes. [<i>Goes up to desk.</i>] You won't reproach me?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Of course I won't.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I can bear anything except your reproaches. Promise you won't
reproach me.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I won't, unless&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Unless what?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> It's something too awful.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh, it isn't. Not at all. Not at all. [<i>Goes up to the desk,

There! You see, it's nothing.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I remember that last two hundred pounds and how you sweedled me
out of it!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Sweedled?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes! Sweedled!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> There's no such word!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No, but there's the thing! As most husbands know. [<i>Referring

Couldn't you manage to pitch your voice in rather a softer key?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Comes angrily down to her, bills in hand, speaks in a

goes and runs up bills like these, [<i>dashing the back of one hand

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Very well, if you don't care how shabby I look&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Shabby! [<i>Referring to bills.</i>] Lace demi-toilette! Point de

<p><i>Dolly.</i> My dear Harry, do you suppose we shall ever agree as to what

<p><i>Harry.</i> No, I'm hanged if we ever shall!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Then I shall not be seen in the same street with you.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You won't?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No, my dear. Make no mistake about that!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You'll be seen with somebody else, perhaps?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> What's that to do with your bills?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> A great deal. That night at dinner she told you her dress
allowance was a hundred and twenty a year, and you said you wished she'd
give me a few lessons in economy.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I did not.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Pardon me, you did!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Pardon me, I did not. I said she might give <i>some</i> women a

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You did not! I heard every word of your conversation, and you

<p><i>Harry.</i> I'll swear I didn't!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Ask my father! He was there.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Very well! I'll ask him the first thing in the morning.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> The girl at the hotel at Folkestone, that Harry paid so much

<p><i>Harry.</i> I paid no more attention to Miss Smithson than was absolutely
necessary. Did I, Mr. Barron?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh! Oh! Dad, you remember&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Not for the moment&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Not the disgraceful way Harry&mdash;there's no other word&mdash;carried

<p><i>Harry.</i> I did not carry on&mdash;Mr. Barron, I appeal to you.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Dad!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> My dear, I certainly did not notice&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No, he was far too careful to let anyone notice it, except his

<p><i>Harry.</i> You lay your life when I do carry on my wife will be the last

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I daresay! Dad, did you hear that?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Yes. [<i>Rousing himself a little.</i>] Now, Harry, what about this
Miss Smithson?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> That's what I want to know!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Who is Miss Smithson?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Surely you remember that lanky girl&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Miss Smithson is not lanky&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Not lanky? Not lanky?! You can't have any eyes&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> That's the one!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I should call her a trifle lanky, Harry.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Cautiously.</i>] Ye-es.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You remember how she waited for a lull in the talk, and then
she said with that silly, simpering, appealing look&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Miss Smithson's look is not silly or simpering.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Well, it's appealing, isn't it?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>With a little chuckle.</i>] Oh, yes, it's appealing.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Enraged.</i>] Oh! Dad!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Quiets her.</i>] Shush!&mdash;What did she say?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> She said with a very marked glance at me, "My dress allowance
is a hundred and twenty a year, and I don't understand how any
reasonable woman can wish for more!" What do you think of that?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Well, if she did say that, and if she glanced at you, it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> It wasn't very nice of her.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Nice? It was an insult! A direct, intentional, abominable
insult, wasn't it?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Yes, yes, decidedly, under the circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> And Harry ought to have resented it?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> At his own dinner table he couldn't, could he?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes! At least, if he couldn't resent it, he ought to have

<p><i>Harry.</i> I did not!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Yes, but I don't quite remember&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> You said, "What on earth was up between her and Miss Smithson

<p><i>Lucas.</i> They've gone to meet me?</p>

<p><i>Criddle.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> By the road?</p>

<p><i>Criddle.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> That's how I've missed them. My car broke down the other side
of the clump, and so I walked over the fields.</p>

<p><i>Criddle.</i> Yes, sir. I beg pardon, I hope the arm isn't serious.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> No, Criddle. Just serious enough to get me a couple of months'
leave, so that I could spend the New Year in England.</p>

<p><i>Criddle.</i> You had it very hot in India, I suppose, sir?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Blazing!</p>

<p><i>Criddle.</i> We've got the same old weather here, you see, sir.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Same old weather! Had any visitors for Christmas, Criddle?</p>

<p><i>Criddle.</i> Mr. Barron, of course, and Professor and Mrs. Sturgess.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Same old visitors&mdash;same visitors, I should say. Mr. Pilcher
still Vicar here, I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Criddle.</i> Yes, sir. He gave us a wonderful sermon at the old year's
service last night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Same old sermon!</p>

<p><i>Criddle.</i> No, sir. Not exactly the same sermon, though it had similar
points to last year. Ah! You came over for the old year's service last
year?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Yes, and a rattling good sermon it was!</p>

<p><i>Criddle.</i> Very powerful and persuading, wasn't it, sir? It even touched
me up a bit.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> In what way, Criddle?</p>

<p><i>Criddle.</i> I used to have my ten bob on any horse as I fancied, but I
never put a farthing on anything&mdash;not even on Sulky Susan for the Oaks.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> You didn't?</p>

<p><i>Criddle.</i> No, and thank God, in a manner of speaking, that I didn't,
for she never pulled it off. I owe that to Mr. Pilcher. No, I never
touched a thing till the Leger. That reminds me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> What, Criddle?</p>

<p><i>Criddle.</i> Why, last year, after Mr. Pilcher's sermon, the master had a
collecting box, and when he found himself going a bit off the straight
he used to put in a shilling or half-a-crown for Mr. Pilcher's blanket
fund&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Yes, of course! And Uncle Matt promised him a sovereign for
each of us if we had carried out our good resolutions. Is that coming
off, Criddle?</p>

<p><i>Criddle.</i> I expect it is, sir. Mr. Pilcher is coming here this
afternoon, and the master told me to be sure and find the box before he
gets here.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Find the box?</p>

<p><i>Criddle.</i> Nobody has seen anything of it for some months. Excuse me,
sir, I must look for it.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Of your infatuation for her.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Infatuation? Well, I admired her, and perhaps it was lucky I
was ordered out to India&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I managed that for you, my boy.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> You did!?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Sir John wanted a smart A.D.C., so I drove over to Aldershot,
urged your claims, and got you the appointment.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Yes, much obliged to you, much obliged!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> So you ought to be. And so's the lady.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Is she?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Yes. When we got your wire yesterday saying you'd motor down
to-day, Dolly had a long talk with her, and the result was she thanked
Dolly and me for getting you out of the way and saving her from you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Did she?</p>

have kissed me, only I didn't feel myself quite worthy.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Oh, so that's all settled!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> That's all settled. At least, let's hope so.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Well, you won't come&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> Very interesting. I should like to discuss the matter with

upon&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Again offering the proof.</i></p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> I should like to look through those sheets, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Glancing at</i> <span class="smcap">Matt</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Prof.</i> You shall! I have put the whole argument into the concrete case
of Sarah Mumford&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> Sarah Mumford?</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> The baby farmer&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Sarah's gray matter gone watery?</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Not watery, but she had a yellow effusion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I suppose that's just as bad?</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Quite.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> What did they do with her?</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> They hanged her. They then discovered extensive
<a name="corr12" id="corr12"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn12" title="changed from 'lessions'">
lesions</a> and this
yellow effusion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Pity they didn't discover that before they hanged her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> My exact point! Where is the justice of punishing a woman whose
gray matter functions perversely? It is nothing short of a crime.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> But she had suffocated five dear little babies?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> How could she avoid suffocating babies if she had a yellow
effusion in her brain?</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Precisely my argument&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Puts his proofs into</i> <span class="smcap">Matt's</span> <i>hands.
Points out a passage</i>. <span class="smcap">Matt</span>, <i>a little embarrassed, takes them, looks

<p><i>Prof.</i> The point I wish to establish is this. While we all allow that
extensive or recognizable diseases of, or injuries to, the brain, free a
man from responsibility and punishment, how can we logically mete out
blame or praise, punishment or reward to our ordinary acts, thoughts,
and impulses, seeing that all our acts, thoughts, and impulses, good or
bad, virtuous or criminal, are equally the mere expressions of certain
inevitable physical changes in the brain, the mere register on the dial
plate of consciousness of necessary predetermined complications in the
working of certain atoms of the gray matter of our cortex?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Quite so! Quite so! [<span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>is about to speak, but</i> <span class="smcap">Matt</span> <i>hushes
her down with a warning look and sign.</i>] The Professor wants to say with
Socrates that no man would be such a fool as to do wrong, if he could
possibly help it.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Well, if you like to put it that way&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> And now perhaps we might proceed. Can you remember the exact
terms, Mr. Barron?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I am to pay a sovereign for everyone of your hearers who has so
far benefited by the wise admonitions of your last year's sermon as to
have broken off his bad habits, or some especial bad habit&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> We aren't bound to say what the habit is that we've broken
off?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I don't wish to be inquisitive, but if you don't mention the
particular bad habit, you will have to give me your word of honor that
you've conquered it. [<i>Putting down proofs on table, taking up the
money-box, giving it a shake.</i>] Now, who will be first to step into the
confessional? [<i>Looking round.</i></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I will. As I've nothing to confess.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Nothing?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No. I had what some husbands might think a bad habit, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No bills this Christmas, eh, Doll?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> You're sure now, my darling?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> None of any importance.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> What do you mean of any importance?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Well, you must have some bills&mdash;they grow up before you
know&mdash;such as Doctors' bills&mdash;you can't settle them all on the spur of
the moment, but I've nothing&mdash;nothing of importance. So please put in
your sovereign for me, Dad, and look pleasant about it.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> You declare upon your word of honor that you have broken off
your bad habit of running up bills?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Entirely?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes. You said you wouldn't be inquisitive.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> Mrs. Telfer has given her word. I think I may claim one
victory for free will, [<i>nodding victoriously at the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>who
shakes his head</i>], and one sovereign for the Blanket Club.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Hum! [<i>Draws a sovereign out of his pocket and very reluctantly
drops it into the box, shakes his head at</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>who looks a little
uncomfortable.</i>] Who volunteers next?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> I do. No&mdash;I'll wait a little&mdash;I want to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> sure that I am
perfectly honest with myself and with everybody.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> That perhaps may need a little consideration, Lucas?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Oh, let Harry have his doing first!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Now, Harry!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh, well, here goes! I'm going to make a clean breast. The fact
is I've made a thundering mess of it.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Ah!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I did begin all right except for a little tiff with Dolly&mdash;and
then I kept on pretty well for some time, and then&mdash;well I don't know&mdash;I
seemed to go all to pieces and&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Matt</span> <i>rattles the money-box.</i>] However,
better luck this year.</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> Shall we say a little more resolution?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Oh, I mean to pull myself together this year.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Perhaps you tried too much reforming, Harry&mdash;too many irons in
the fire, eh?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Well, it's jolly hard to keep it up. And I'd got pretty slack
till you woke us up last night&mdash;I say, that was a rouser again.</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> It wasn't a very bad sermon, was it? Well now for the next
year shall we make one especial effort in one especial
direction&mdash;Say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Temper, eh, Harry?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Right, old girl! Oh, I mean it.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> No victory for free will, and the Blanket Club, this time. Game
and game, eh? Now which of you two&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Renie</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucas</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Renie.</i> I'll be your first victim. [<i>Coming into the middle of the
room, and posing.</i>] It's so strange that what you started as a jest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Oh no, in deadly earnest I assure you.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> In this life who knows what is jest and what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> is earnest? The
least little innocent thing may turn to a tragedy in a moment&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Surely you haven't had any little tragedies?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> No, last year a mere little circumstance might have turned to a
tragedy&mdash;honestly I wasn't to blame, but perhaps I was a little
careless, and two dear friends came to me with their counsel, and what
might have been a tragedy was turned to a comedy, thanks to those two
dear friends!</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> My dear, may I ask "what circumstance" you are alluding to?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> We said we wouldn't be inquisitive&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> No, but I cannot recall anything in my wife's life during the
last twelve months that even approached a tragedy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> I said the affair was quite unimportant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Then I wish, my dear, you wouldn't magnify everything, and I
wish you would read solid scientific works in place of rubbishy French
novels&mdash;and above all, take a little more regular exercise!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Perhaps Mrs. Sturgess may consider that little point during the
coming year. Meantime, [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Renie</span>] may we be confident your little
tragedy is ended&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Oh yes, quite.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> We needn't ask its nature, but you give us your word of honor?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Looks at her very searchingly and speaking seriously.</i>]</p></div>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Yes, my word of honor.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Thank you.</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> Another victory.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Looks searchingly at her, drops a sovereign in the box.</i>]
Lucas?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> [<i>Coming cheerfully forward.</i>] My turn for the thumbscrew!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> You seem very cheerful about it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Yes, I'm going to make a jolly good show.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> What particular bad habit have you conquered during the past
year?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> I don't know that I've conquered any one in particular, but
I've had a regular good go in all round, so altogether I can pat myself
on the back.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> But I want to know one particular habit conquered&mdash;for instance,
you weren't very careful what ladies you made love to, or how many of
them at the same time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> I say, Uncle Matt, drop this&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> And a year or two ago you went just a little bit off the
straight&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Oh no I didn't.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I want to know&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Thank you, no more thumbscrew. I'm out of this before it goes
any further.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> It isn't going any further. [<i>Putting his hand on</i> <span class="smcap">Lucas's</span>
<i>shoulder.</i>] Give me your word of honor&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> That's all very well, it wasn't a very bad case, and I don't
think you should have brought it up. But as you have&mdash;well, I did meet a
lady, and I was very much attracted to her, but I summoned all my
resolution, and there the matter ended.</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> I think I may claim a victory here.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> So please put in your sovereign.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Very seriously.</i>] If you will give me your word of honor that
you have absolutely broken off&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Yes, yes, of course I have.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Matt</span> <i>puts in a sovereign, hands the box to</i> <span class="smcap">Pilcher</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> Three victories and one draw out of four. Most satisfactory.
[<i>Taking out watch.</i>] I must hurry off to the White House and see what
they're doing there. [<i>Rattling the box.</i>] Excellent results! So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
excellent that I think I'm justified in making you a little New Year's
gift.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Going to his heap of brown-paper parcels.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> A New Year's gift! How kind of you! To me?</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> [<i>Opening his parcel.</i>] To you and your husband. To your
husband in particular, because, although he may have fallen a little
short of perfection during the last year&mdash;like some of the rest of
us&mdash;yet I feel sure that during this coming year&mdash;[<i>They have all been
watching him curiously; he has now opened the parcel and displays a very
bright brand new collecting box, with Crookbury Blanket Club painted on
it, in large letters. It is much larger than the hospital box.</i>] My
household regulator! [<i>Giving it to</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span>.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Who has shown considerable disappointment on the opening of
the parcel.</i>] Crookbury Blanket Club! Thank you so much, for Harry's
sake. Harry! For you, dear.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She gives the box to</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, <i>who places it on the same table.</i>]</p></div>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You call it the household regulator?</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> Yes&mdash;I have suggested it to several of my brethren. Oh, its
use will become very general throughout the diocese.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You think it will work well?</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> It cannot fail. A box of this character&mdash;larger or smaller,
according to the size of the family and their behaviour is left at each
house on the first of the year. All little failings, peccadilloes, and
asperities are strictly fined. The inevitable result is that either the
family behaviour improves, or the parish charities benefit. I'm starting
its operation in my parish to-day. Forgive any inexcusable rudeness in
leaving the first box with you. I must hurry off! [<i>Shaking hands.</i>]
Good-bye, Professor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> I should like to make that point clear with regard to free
will&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> When you have an hour, or shall I say a year, to spare, we
might argue it out&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> You're going to the White House? If I might accompany you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pilcher.</i> Delighted!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Shakes hands in dumb show with</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Renie, you've had your restless fits again. You'd better come
with us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> But I've already been walking&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> My dear, this bracing country air is just what you need. Keep
out in it all the day long&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Oh, very well&mdash;the White House, and the fish-pond as usual, I
suppose?</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> As usual. Come along.</p>

there!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Doll, you really haven't got any bills this year?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No! no! Only the few little oddments that no woman can prevent.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> You might let me see the little oddments&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I will. [<i>Suddenly.</i>] Oh Harry, I quite forgot! Do forgive me!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I never wrote the geyser bath people!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Never mind the geyser bath.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> And only this morning you rowed me because I hadn't got it
ready for the New Year! Where did you put their address?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I don't know! Somewhere upstairs among my papers.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Gently pushing him off.</i>] I can just catch to-night's post!
Make haste and get it! Quick! There's a dear! And then we can get the
bath fixed up for you next week.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Oh, Dolly!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> What's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Oh, Dolly!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> What is it?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> [<i>Throws her arms round</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>affectionately.</i>] You've always
been such a true friend to me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes, dear.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> More like a sister. And I know I may trust you now.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>A little suspicious.</i>] Yes. Has anything happened?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Yes. Oh, Dolly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Tell me!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> As we were going out at the garden gate, Captain Wentworth held
out a letter behind his back for me to take&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> What?!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> But now his arm is wounded he couldn't manage it properly, and
he dropped it. I hurried to pick it up, and then my husband noticed and
insisted on reading it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> What was in the letter?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> It wasn't so very bad, but my husband has chosen to jump to a
wrong conclusion, and&mdash;oh, Dolly, you can help me!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Coldly, relaxing her embrace.</i>] How?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> If you'd only let me tell my husband that I was receiving it
for you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> What?!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> There was no address, and fortunately it was so worded that it
showed that you weren't really guilty.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Oh! I wasn't really guilty?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> In fact, it proves your complete innocence.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I'm glad of that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Then you'll let me say it was you?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No! You can't suppose I should let my own cousin make love to
me in my own house?!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> You won't help me?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes, any way but that! How could you be so foolish?</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> I don't know. When I heard yesterday he was coming, I quite
made up my mind I'd have nothing to say to him! Dolly, free will must be
an illusion, or else why am I always doing the things I don't mean to
do. Oh, what shall I do?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> As you are completely innocent, you'd better ask your husband
to forgive you.</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> Ye&mdash;es. No! As it is a perfectly pure and exalted attachment I
shall take that ground&mdash;at any rate at first, and see what he says.
You'll help me all you can?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes, but promise me you'll have nothing to do with Lucas in
future!</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> No, indeed! if I once get out of this.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Very well! I'll see what I can do.&mdash;Hush!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>enters with a letter in his hand</i>, <span class="smcap">Matt</span> <i>soothing him.</i></div>

<p><i>Prof.</i> [<i>Very angry.</i>] Not a word more, if you please. Mrs. Telfer, you
have doubtless heard&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> I leave for London to-night-to consult my lawyer. Mrs. Sturgess

<p><i>Prof.</i> What explanation can be offered of language like this. [<i>Reading
from letter.</i>] "From the first moment I saw you, I felt that you were
entirely different from any woman I have ever met&mdash;&mdash;" A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> monstrously
inexact statement to start with. And a woman who is capable of
practising such deceit&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Renie</span> <i>bursts into tears</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I think you ought to hear what Mrs. Sturgess has to say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Renie.</i> [<i>Through her tears.</i>] What would be the use? With such a
nature as his he could never begin to understand the loyal and exalted
devotion which Captain Wentworth feels for me! No, all my life I have
been misunderstood, misjudged, condemned! Let it be so till the end!
Dolly, come and help me pack!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Exit</i>. <span class="smcap">Matt</span> <i>goes up to table and takes up proofs of</i> <span class="smcap">Professor's</span>
<i>book and looks through them.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You're really too severe with poor Renie&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> I am not severe. I simply register the inevitable sentence of
the husband upon the wife who misconducts herself!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Misconducts herself! She has merely had a little harmless
flirtation&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> In my wife a flirtation of this character [<i>pointing to letter
in his hand</i>] constitutes grave misconduct.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> But that's perfectly ridiculous! Why it might happen to any
woman! Dad, explain to him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Professor, you're taking altogether a wrong view of this. Now
this case you were pointing out to me in your own book [<i>pointing to
proofs</i>]&mdash;Number forty-nine, Mrs. Copway. Remarkably handsome woman
too!&mdash;[<i>reading</i>] "The injustice and cruelty of condemning this poor
lady must be apparent to all." My dear Professor, before publishing this
book you'll have to modify your theory.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> I cannot modify my theory. I have spent ten years in collecting
facts which prove it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Then, pardon me, you must really look over Mrs. Sturgess's
little indiscretion.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> That is equally impossible&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> But you say that her action in receiving my nephew's letter was
entirely due to the activity of certain atoms in the gray matter of her
brain.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Undoubtedly that is so.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Very well then, if her gray matter keeps on working wrong,
what's the use of blaming her? You say yourself there's no such thing as
free will&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Precisely, but I have always allowed that in the present low
moral and intellectual condition of the herd of mankind, free will is a
plausible working hypothesis.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> But it doesn't work! Free will won't work at all! Look at my
own case! Do you suppose I should go on all my life having bills if I
could help myself? [<i>Catching</i> <span class="smcap">Matt's</span> <i>eye, who looks at her gravely and
holds up his finger.</i>] Never mind my bills! Do make him see how wrong
and absurd it is to punish poor Renie when there's no such thing as free
will!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Dolly's right! She's only saying what you have so admirably laid
down here. My dear Professor, you cannot possibly publish this book!</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> But it has been announced! I must publish it.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> You cannot. Read that. [<i>Giving the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>the book and
pointing out passage.</i>] Surely after that you cannot condemn Mrs.
Sturgess.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> [<i>Taking book, glancing at the passage.</i>] Really, it's most
annoying when one's own wife upsets&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Oh! they're always making hay of our theories one way or the
other.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Of course, if one presses the matter home to first
principles&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes! Yes! Well, why not act on your own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> first principles! You
ought to be very sorry for poor Renie, considering all she has suffered.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Suffered?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes, poor dear! You don't know what an awful struggle she has
gone through between this unfortunate flirtation and her admiration for
you.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> Her admiration for me!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes! She always speaks of you as her great protagonist of
science.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> [<i>Mollified.</i>] Does she? Does she?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes. If I were you I should go upstairs, and be very sweet to
her, and above all don't reproach her. We women can endure anything
except reproaches&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> [<i>Looking at his proofs.</i>] I must publish my book. And after
all, as you say, it is useless to blame them for acting according to
the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> The dictates of their gray matter when, bless them, they can't
help themselves. My dear Professor, instead of condemning your wife you
ought to be condoling with her, and doing all you can to get her gray
matter into a healthy condition.</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> I will hear what she has to say.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No. Go straight to her and forgive her, and then I'm sure her
gray matter will soon be all right. And what a triumph that will be for
you!</p>

<p><i>Prof.</i> It does offer a way out of the difficulty. In any case I must
publish my book. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Dad, I won't have her here next Christmas.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> No, my dear, I wouldn't.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> That wretched Lucas!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> What is to be done with him?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Pack him off! Pack him off at once!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> I say, how's the old bird seem to take it?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Old bird!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> He isn't going to make a shindy over a trifle like this?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Trifle! He's threatening to divorce her and expose you!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> You don't say so. I'm awfully sorry!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Sorry!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> I am, indeed! And any reparation I can make&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Reparation?!</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Such as an apology&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>utters a contemptuous exclamation.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Will you give me your word of honor never to see Mrs. Sturgess
again?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Or write to her?</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> The word of honour of an English gentleman used to mean
something, Lu.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> It does now, Uncle Matt!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>Shakes hands with him heartily.</i>] Then I'll take it. Now be
off as quickly as you can and let us make the best of it for you and
her.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> Thanks. Good-bye!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Good-bye!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Lucas</span> <i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span>, <i>offers his hand.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> No, Lu. If Renie gets out of this safely and if you behave
yourself, I'll shake hands with you when you come back from India.</p>

<p><i>Lucas.</i> You're taking this too seriously&mdash;you're taking it far too
seriously! [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> We're making a splendid start again for the New Year!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I hope this will be a lesson for Renie!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I hope so. How about yourself?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I put the sovereign in, but&mdash;you've got a few more bills, eh?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Just a few oddments.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> How much?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I don't know. Dad&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Well?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Now that South Africans have gone up at last, and you won that
splendid coup on them last week&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Well?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You couldn't lend me&mdash;a few hundreds&mdash;till my allowance comes
due? Just a few hundreds&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> [<i>In a low reproachful tone, shaking his head.</i>] What? What?
What? Sad! Sad! Sad!!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Listens.</i>] There's Harry! You will help me, Dad&mdash;you will?</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> I'll see what I can do.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>enters cheerfully.</i></div>

<p><i>Harry.</i> That's all right, Doll! There's the address.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Giving a slip of paper.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Thanks, dear.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> And now about these mere oddments?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Not now, dear.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, dear, now. [<i>Very sternly.</i>] This instant!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Harry, you're going to lose your temper&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No. I'm going to keep a firm guard on it, but [<i>very sternly</i>]
let me see those bills.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Creeps frightened up to the desk.</i>] I'm sure you're going to
lose your temper.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Opens the desk.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Firmly.</i>] No. I'm quite calm. Whose bill is that? [<i>She hands
him one timorously.</i>] Fulks and Garner! Artist Furriers! More artists!

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Ah, Jobling!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I should think I am Jobling. And you said you'd never enter
their shop again!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I never meant it, but this time it was absolutely necessary&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Necessary?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Yes&mdash;you see the chief item&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Reads.</i>] Chinchilla toque, coat, muff and boa&mdash;eighty
guineas&mdash;eighty guineas&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I got them as a surprise for you when we go South next week.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Surprise! Great heavens! What in the name of all&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Shush, Harry! Her motive was a good one. She got it to please
you!</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> You haven't seen it yet, it's just outside&mdash;I've a great mind
to give you a great New Year's treat and let you see it on!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I'm not going to be sweedled&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Hush! Harry! Let her put it on! Let's have a look at it, and see
whether it's worth the money. Put it on, Doll. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span>.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Calls after her.</i>] I tell you I'm not going to be
sweedled!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> What is sweedled?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Sweedling is sweedling! It's part swindling and part wheedling!
It's what every d&mdash;ee&mdash;d good-natured husband like me has to go through,
when he's fool enough to put up with it!</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> Well, old boy, you'll have to pay, you know; it will come to
that in the end.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I'm not going to be sweedled&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> And if Dolly has been a little extravagant, I must help her out
with it to-morrow morning!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No, we'll go into it thoroughly to-night.</p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> No, Harry, we won't. My room is just above here. Besides, the
cook is going to give us a special New Year dinner, and I want to enjoy
it. This New Year we'll start with a comfortable evening, please!</p>
